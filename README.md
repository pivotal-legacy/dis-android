## Description

[Pivotal Labs](http://pivotallabs.com) engineers and data scientists will collaborate on building an Android
app named "dis" that makes predictions of about incidents occurring on the
London Underground. Through this we hope to learn about various Pivotal
products (mainly Spring XD) and how they can fit into our process. There is
also a hope to be able to contribute back to the Android ecosystem.

## Backlog

The backlog for the project can be found [here](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1278296).

## Releases

You can download releases of the Dis Android app on our Github releases page [here](https://github.com/pivotal/dis/releases).
