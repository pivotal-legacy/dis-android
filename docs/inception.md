# dis Inception Notes

## Project Description

Labs engineers and data scientists will collaborate on building an Android
app named "dis" that makes predictions of about incidents occurring on the
London Underground. Through this we hope to learn about various Pivotal
products (mainly Spring XD) and how they can fit into our process. There is
also a hope to be able to contribute back to the Android ecosystem.

## Goals

The things we want to achieve/questions we want to answer are:

* How do Labs engineers work with Data Science?
* Learn about using Spring XD within Labs process
* Predict resolution time of tube incidents
* Allow users to view predictions on their phone
* Contribute to Android ecosystem
* Share everything (code, learnings, process)

## Non Goals

The things we don't need to achieve are:

* Offline support
* Play store release
* Any non Android client
* Sales demo
* Prediction of knock on incidents
* Any other predictions
* Suggest action to the user
* Incorporate scheduled maintenance data in predictions

## Risks

The risks to the project in order of perceived severity (with comments
on mitigation) are:

1. Availability of engineers (schedule work in smallest chunks possible)
2. Data science availability (focus on simplest possible prediction model)
3. Spring XD being inappropriate/awkward (timebox time trying to use it)

## Users/Actions

The users and the actions they want to carry out are:

### Robbie the commuter

* See current line disruptions
* See disruption severity/type
* See disruption resolution prediction time (as range) eg "Ends sometime between 16:00 and 16:20"

### Nadia the Pivotal employee

* Read all the code
* Understand how to deploy and test Spring XD
* Understand how predictions in the system are made
* Understand process of working with data science (and vice versa)
